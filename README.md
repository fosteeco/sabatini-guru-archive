# Sabatini Guru Site

This was an old high school project that I had lying around in one of my old folders.

Thought I'd convert it into a static site and provide this as an archive.

Wanted free hosting so I'm using GithubPages: https://fosteeco.github.io/sabatini-guru-archive/

To implement a javascript version of the bingo board I copied code from this repo: https://github.com/ktkaushik/bingo-card-generator
