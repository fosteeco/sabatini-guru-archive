<p>Quote: </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Every time you see a beautiful woman, someone is tired of her, so the men say. And I know where they go, these women, with their tired beauty that someone doesn’t want – these women who must live like the high Sierra white pine, there since before the birth of Christ, fed somehow by the alpine wind.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">They reach out to the animals, day after day smoothing fur inside a cage, saying, “How is Mama’s baby? Is Mama’s baby lonesome?”</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">The women leave at the end of the day, stopping to ask an attendant, “Will they go to good homes?” And come back in a day or so, stooping to examine a one-eyed cat, asking, as though they intend to adopt, “How would I introduce a new cat to my dog?” 
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">But there is seldom an adoption; it matters that the women have someone to leave, leaving behind the lovesome creatures who would never leave them, had they once given them their hearts. (157)</p>
